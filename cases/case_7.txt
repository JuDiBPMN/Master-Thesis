Anouk and Jan operate a web shop in Rotterdam through which they sell self-knitted sweaters. The text below describes the process that occurs when a new order comes in through the shop. Sketch the process using BPMN with at least one intermediate event, as well as one pool with two lanes. When a new order comes in, Anouk picks out the relevant sweaters from the storage unit while Jan collects the packaging material from the basement. Afterwards, Anouk assembles the parcel. Once the parcel has been put together, Jan needs to take care of the delivery. Their web shop delivers within Rotterdam, within the Netherlands, and internationally. If the customer is in Rotterdam, Jan takes his bicycle and rides it to the customer’s address. Once there, he delivers the parcel directly. If the delivery needs to be sent to another city in the Netherlands, Jan rides his bicycle to the next PostNL shop. He then posts the parcel through PostNL. If, however, it is an international delivery, Jan rides his bicycle to the next DHL store instead. He then sends the parcel out as an international DHL delivery. While Jan is taking care of the delivery, Anouk emails the invoice to the customer. Once both have completed their tasks, the order has been completed.
