When the customer orders products on the website of Yamaha, the stock is checked for availability of the needed parts by the Logistics department. If there is no stock of products, the order is rejected and the customer is reimbursed by the Sales department. If the parts are available the order is confirmed by the Sales department. The Sales department then sends the invoice to the customer and at the same time the Logistics department ships the goods to the address of the customer. The process ends when the goods are shipped and the invoice is sent.
