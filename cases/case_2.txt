The employee initiates an idea for a project. He needs to record the basic idea in a document and express its value for the company. He then needs to submit a request for approval to the manager of his team. The manager assesses the request for approval. If the project is approved, he will initiate a project plan. This involves simultaneously laying out a timeline, setting up a budget and stating the required resources. When this is done, the project is started. If otherwise, he rejects the plan, he will communicate the rejection to his employee.
