A customer brings in a defective hardware device. The Service Desk Clerk first registers the claim. Then, they check if the device is still under warranty. If the device is not under warranty, the clerk sends a cost estimate to the customer. If the customer rejects the estimate, the device is returned unrepaired and the case is closed. If the customer accepts, or if the device was originally under warranty, a Technician performs a technical check. Following the check, two tasks are performed in parallel: the Technician repairs the hardware, and the System Admin performs a software update. Once both are finished, the Technician performs a final test. If the test fails, both the hardware repair and software update are repeated. If it passes, the clerk packages the device and the case is closed.
