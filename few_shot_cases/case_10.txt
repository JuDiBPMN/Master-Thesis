The finance department receives an invoice. Simultaneously, a clerk verifies the invoice amount and checks that the purchase order matches. Once both checks are completed, the clerk books the invoice in the accounting system. The invoice is then paid and the finance department notifies the supplier that payment has been made. The supplier receives the payment notification and the process ends.
