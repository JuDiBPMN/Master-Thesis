A patient schedules an appointment and visits the doctor. The doctor examines the patient and decides whether lab tests are needed. If lab tests are needed, the doctor sends a test request to the lab. The lab processes the test request, performs the tests and sends the results back to the doctor. The doctor reviews the results and prescribes a treatment to the patient. The patient receives the treatment prescription and the process ends. If no lab tests are needed, the doctor directly prescribes a treatment to the patient. The patient receives the prescription and the process ends.
