A bank employee starts a loan application review. First, the employee checks the applicant's credit score. Based on the result, a decision is made. If the credit score is sufficient, the loan is approved and the applicant is notified of the approval. If the credit score is insufficient, the loan is rejected and the applicant is notified of the rejection. In both cases the process ends.
